This website hosts a collection of data science, machine learning, statistics, and business intelligence articles, tutorials and experiments.

My reasons for creating this website are to simplify topics in data science so that anyone can understand them, and to have a place where I can dump
my own research.  I hope that others who share a fondness of learning and data science will find this website useful. 

## About Me

My name is Nicholas Lincoln.  I am a Data Scientist in Tampa, FL.  I began my career in business intelligence but transitioned to machine learning 
and predictive analysis.  I am a self-taught programmer, and I strongly believe that a degree is no longer necessary to be successful in data science, 
as long as one has the desire to learn and the motivation to continuously improve.  As stated above, that is one of the reasons I created this 
website; to serve as another resource for people interested in the field, regardless of their background.
