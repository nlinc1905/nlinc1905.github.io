For the last 4 years, I have been blogging on [2centsapieceblogspot.com](https://2centsapiece.blogspot.com).  
Now I am switching to GitHub Pages.  Not only does the new website have a simpler and trendier look, but GitHub 
makes it incredibly easy to publish new posts and add code snippets.  My old blog posts will still be available 
on [2centsapieceblogspot.com](https://2centsapiece.blogspot.com) but all of my future posts will be here.
